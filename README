## UNESCO HERITAGE MAP REVAMP
The current UNESCO World Heritage site is clunky, outdated, and frustrating to work with.
Unfortunately, this is a poor representation of the purpose of UNESCO, which is to preserve
and honor our tradition as human beings. Without a simplistic UI and easily accessible
information, people are more likely to forget about these world heritage sites and, more
importantly, forget about the great achievements and structures of humanity.
Our goal, using the XLS file provided by the UNESCO site itself, is to read data in for one
singular country and create a more useable website for people to explore. This will include
descriptions and historical information about the site. To avoid scope creep, we are only
performing this exercise on one country and with relatively limited features/functionality.
However, we aim to build it in a way that will make a project such as this easily expandable.
